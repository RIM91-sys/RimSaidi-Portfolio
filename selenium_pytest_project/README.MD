# 🧪 Project: Test Automation

This project involved the automation of test cases that were originally created as part of the [Test Plan & Test Case Design homework](https://www.notion.so/212fc8ca6c014f7d9ca860ba5477f83e?pvs=21).  
The system under test was [**GroceryMate**](https://grocerymate.masterschool.com), a web-based grocery shopping platform.

The goal was to apply best practices in automated software testing using **Selenium**, **PyTest**, and the **Page Object Model (POM)**.

## ✅ Objectives

- ✅ Translate manual test cases into automated scripts  
- ✅ Implement the Page Object Model to improve maintainability and scalability  
- ✅ Organize test suites for modularity and clarity  
- ✅ Integrate fixtures, parameterized tests, and utility modules  
- ✅ Generate clean, informative test reports

- 📄 Test structure followed Page Object Model (POM) principles  
- 🧪 Test cases implemented under the `tests/` directory  
- 🔧 WebDriver managed using a PyTest fixture (`conftest.py`)  
- 🔁 Used `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for running tests with different data sets  
- 📁 Test data, credentials, and URLs stored in `utils/constants.py`  
- ✔️ Assertions were clear and meaningful
